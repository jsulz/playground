# Welcome!

This is the home of a simple Flask application where I store pet projects.

If the projects get complex enough, I might pull them out of this repository so they can have their own home.

For now, however, these are toy projects to help me learn and practice.

Check out https://playground.jsulz.com to see them in action.
