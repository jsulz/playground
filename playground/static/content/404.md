Whoops! You came across a URL that no longer works. Sorry for that. Please head back [home](/) or peruse any of these fine 404 pages from other websites. I love a good Easter egg:

- [GitHub - Octocat Jedi!](https://github.com/thisisnotthepageyourlookingfor)
- [Spotify spinning vinyl](https://www.spotify.com/us/thisisnotthepageyourlookingfor/) (that's all HTML and CSS!)
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/thisisnotthepageyourlookingfor) (speaking of just CSS)
- [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/thisisnotthepageyourlookingfor) of course they'd have something pretty and fun.
